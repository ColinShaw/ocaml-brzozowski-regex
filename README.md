# Brzozowski Derivative Approach to Regular Expressions in OCaml

This is a brief implementation of a regular expression processor using Brzozowski's 
derivative method.  The code doesn't include a RegEx parses, just evaluation of the RegEx based on 
abstract syntax.  This was used in a presentation for Computer Science Club.
